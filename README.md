### Hi there! I'm Pauline~ 

I’m a full stack software engineer based in LA. I love transforming ideas into intuitive, polished experiences. I’m all about writing thoughtful code, going on playful side quests, and building things that feel *good* to use. Whether I’m crafting internal tools or building creative apps, I bring care and attention to detail to every project.

Lately, I've been prototyping tools that blend utility and engineering with a touch of whismy - most recently a [tarot card journal](https://github.com/pauline-ann/tarot-journal) - and continuing to sharpen my problem-solving skills through system design and coding challenges.

Some of my favorite tools include `React`, `Node.js`, `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `MongoDB`, `Tailwind`, `Vite`, `Next.js`, `Cypress`, `Jest`, `Storybook`, `Postman`, and `Git` (of course!).

In past projects, I've:

- Developed responsive, component-based UIs with `React`, `TypeScript`, and `Tailwind`

- Built full stack features and REST APIs using `Node.js`, `Express`, and `MongoDB`

- Translated `Figma` designs into polished, accessible interfaces

- Created internal tools and dashboards with third-party integrations (`Stripe`, `Meta`, `GCP`, etc.)

- Maintained code quality and dev experience using `Cypress`, `Jest`, `Storybook`, and `Swagger`
